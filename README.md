## Project Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the U.S. job market more than any other 
event since at least the Great Recession of 2007-09, and the financial panic 
that followed. As the COVID-19 pandemic brought the economy to a sudden halt, 
the number of layoffs have increased sharply compared to the pre-COVID times. 
Most non-essential workers had to adapt from making their home their workplace, 
and this obviated the commute to and from work daily for a significant portion 
of the US population. Using the labor statistics data, movement range maps data, 
and tweets, we aim to explore how the COVID-19 has affected the working population 
of the United States. We address this question by examining the state trends in 
unemployment rate, differences in daily movement patterns of the population, and 
changes in wage and working hours in different industries. The data we collected 
are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Meta's Data for Good, and Twitter.
