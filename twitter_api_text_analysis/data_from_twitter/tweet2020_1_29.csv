17.7% of blacks live below the poverty line. 9% of whites are below.
Better than it was, but not good. Not good at all."

He‚Äôs appointed Constitutional originalist judges, lowered taxes, &amp; lowered unemployment, (which lowered gov‚Äôt assistance.)
These are ALL solid Republican ideals."

Maybe they need to go the labor website and look up the current labor statistics and see how unemployment is at an all time low.
97,1.23283E+18,2020-02-27 00:52:44+00:00,@AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me? Evidently you‚Äôve not looked at any labor statistics lately to see how far unemployment has gone down.  It‚Äôs at a historic low.  That‚Äôs only one small item of the improvement that is occurring in this country now.

Of course his ‚ÄúClimate Crisis hoax‚Äù &amp; green new deal which attacks the fossil fuel industry will also cost millions of jobs, not to mention the increase in fuel costs"
